# Gentlix-Bank
Simulation of a complex banking application with a friendly graphical interface.

## Project Status
This project is currently **under active development** and is continuously being improved to enhance its functionality and user experience.

## Overview
Gentlix-Bank is designed to simulate a comprehensive banking system, incorporating a user-friendly graphical interface built with GTK. The project utilizes a layered architecture and simulates object-oriented programming concepts in C, such as classes, through the use of structs and functions.

## Key Features
- **Layered Architecture**: The project is structured into multiple layers, including domain, repository, and services, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- **GUI with GTK**: A graphical user interface is implemented using GTK, providing an intuitive interaction experience for users.
- **Class Simulation in C**: Although C does not support classes natively, the project simulates class-like behavior using structs and function pointers.
- **Transaction Management**: Supports various transaction types, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Account Management**: Allows users to create, edit, and manage their accounts securely.
